# Creating custom shaders for use with JELOS presets
JELOS supports adding custom shaders in addition to the built-in shaders available in the "Advanced Game Options" and "Game Settings / Per System Advanced Configuration" settings.

## Step 1: Launch a game and access the shaders menu in quick settings
If Shaders are set to "off," change to "on" 

## Step 2: Configure Shader settings to preference by modifying existing shaders
Specific parameters will vary on a per-shader basis. Example below is based on a custom shader with two passes for GBA:

In shaders, choose "load" and then load "vba-color" (either from the main list, or if on android/PC, it'll be in the "handhelds" folder.

Once loaded, go down to "shader passes" and change it from 1 to 2. 

For the second pass where it says "N/A" select it, go into the "handhelds" folder again and choose LCD1x. 

Then press "Apply changes" to set it. From there go into "shader parameters" and you'll see the darkening, brighten scanlines, and brighten LCD options. Configure parameters as preferred
Once it's configured to your liking, in the shaders menu press "save" and in the save menu set "Simple Presets" to "off" and then "save shader preset as" and name the custom shader. It'll now be selectable as a default like any of the other preconfigured shaders.


## Step 3: Add your device to your network
